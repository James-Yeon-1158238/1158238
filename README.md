# Weather and SoilType Data Extraction â€“ Steps
1. Load the crop_yield_dataset.csv file
    Load the raw dataset containing crop, soil, weather, and yield information.
2. Inspect the data
    Check the structure, column names, and data types using df.info() and df.head().
3. Extract weather/SoilType-related columns
    Select only the relevant weather features such as Date, Temperature, Humidity, and Wind_Speed.
4. Split the Date column
    Convert the Date column to datetime format and extract Year, Month, and Day into separate columns.
5. Save the weather, Soil dataset
    Export the cleaned and structured weather and Soil data into a new CSV file (e.g., crop_weather_data.csv).

# Review after the first analysis - 18/08/2025
During the first round of analysis, I treated Crop_Yield values of 0 as missing and replaced them with the mean/median. However, while conducting the EDA, I realized that a Crop_Yield value of 0 actually carries meaningful information, so I restarted the work from the beginning.


# Data preprocessing rework in progress - 27/08/2025
- Split the files into Weather and Soil Type without modifying Crop_Yield
- create files: crop_soiltype_data_0.csv, crop_weather_data_0.csv
