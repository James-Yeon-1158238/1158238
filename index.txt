Using your chosen dataset from Kaggle, perform the following tasks as shown in the lab sessions:

 

1.   Data Preprocessing  as appropriate to your dataset. Briefly explain what you do using comments in your Python code.

This step includes (a) cleaning the data;(b) missing data imputation with the methods discussed in the class; and  (c) dealing with outliers.

2.   Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) with your dataset investigating correlations and potential relationships among features as discussed in the lab session. Use appropriate algorithms shown in the lab classes.

3.   Provide insightful comments related to your features within your code.

4.   Briefly discuss the question you could potentially explore with the dataset. Back up your reasons using the EDA you have performed with respect your target variable.

5.   Push your code to GitHub repository on or before 11:49PM, 8th September 2025.
